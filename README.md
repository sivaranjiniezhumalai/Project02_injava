# Project02_injava

I made this project for my understanding with java swing. It has more features than i expect, and it had given me good knowledge about the use of java code with respect to requirment in real time.

Every code took me long for understanding as i am beginner. But it didnt stop me from learning with its good features.
I found the great help needed for me is linking my sql database with my source code file, I hope that i will get more experience on following days. 

Every time i started a project, then it will be starting point in learning path race. Moreover, i'm grateful with this race.

I really hope that beginners can be more useful with this exercise that i provided.
And there is more lot to learn actually with this feartures.
